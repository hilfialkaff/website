<p>I'm a Computer Science Master student in the <a href="http://www.cs.illinois.edu">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>. Previously, I was an undergraduate student at <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu">University of California, Berkeley</a>. My interest lies in the intersection of distributed systems, data mining, social visualization and anything that has social impacts.</p>

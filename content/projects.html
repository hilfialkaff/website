    MatchMate
  </a>
</h2>
<p>
MatchMate is an application that aims to visualize what one values in a
relationship and, based on this information, the relationship compatability
between oneself and others. The visualization utilizes compatabiltiy algorithms
inspired by two primary sources: the OkCupid compatability algorithm and the
Five Languages of Love theory.

    Accelerometer Biometric Competition
  </a>
</h2>
<p>We enroll in Kaggle's Accelerometer Biometric Competition in which we are
being given 60 million unique samples of accelerometer data collected from 387
different devices. The goal of this competition is to recognize users of mobile
devices from accelerometer data.</p>

<h2><a href="./projects.html#">CrowdWatch</a></h2>
<p>CrowdWatch is a novel crowdsourcing mechanism that take advantage of two
distinct radio that exist in phones nowadays, i.e. Bluetooth, which is
short-ranged but more energy-conserving, and WiFi, which is a longer range radio
but is more energy-draining.</p>

<h2><a href="http://tessellation.cs.berkeley.edu/">Tessellation OS</a></h2>

<p>In this project, I implemented resource guarantees policies for the graphic
subsystems and support for ACPI and PCI devices discovery in Tessellation. I
have also helped in porting multiple applications such as Intel TBB and video
players from Linux to Tessellation.</p>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/hilfialkaff/accelerometer-biometric-competition">Accelerometer Biometric Competition</a></h2>
<p>We enroll in Kaggle's Accelerometer Biometric Competition in which we are being given 60 million unique samples of accelerometer data collected from 387 different devices. The goal of this competition is to recognize users of mobile devices from accelerometer data.</p>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/hilfialkaff/chat-formality">Chat Formality</a></h2>
<p>In this project, we analyze the formality of instant messaging chats as we know a person. Formality in this project is being naively determined by the number of occurance of dictionary based words in the chat.</p>

<h2><a href="./projects.html#">CrowdWatch</a></h2>
<p>CrowdWatch is a novel crowdsourcing mechanism that take advantage of two distinct radio that exist in phones nowadays, i.e. Bluetooth, which is short-ranged but more energy-conserving, and WiFi, which is a longer range radio but is more energy-draining.</p>

<h2><a href="http://tessellation.cs.berkeley.edu/">Tessellation OS</a></h2>

<p>In this project, I implemented resource guarantees policies for the graphic subsystems and support for ACPI and PCI devices discovery in Tessellation. I have also helped in porting multiple applications such as Intel TBB and video players from Linux to Tessellation.</p>
